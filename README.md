# sHDP: Nonparametric Topic Modeling with Word Vectors 

Implementation for the spherical HDP (sHDP) introduced in [*Nonparametric Spherical Topic Modeling with Word Embeddings*](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00126v1.pdf). 

The code reads a dataset which is converted into a wordvector representation (and placed in the data folder); it runs a nonparametric topic model with vMF likelihood on the dataset. The generated topics are saved in the results folder.

The code is developed based on [pyhsmm package](https://github.com/mattjj/pyhsmm).
