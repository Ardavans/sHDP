# sHDP: Nonparametric Topic Modeling with Word Vectors 

Implementation for the spherical HDP (sHDP) introduced in [*Nonparametric Spherical Topic Modeling with Word Embeddings*](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00126v1.pdf). 

The code reads a dataset from data folder and runs a nonparametric topic model with vMF likelihood on it. The generated topics are saved in the results folder.  

#Acknowledgement 
The code is developed based on [pyhsmm package](https://github.com/mattjj/pyhsmm).
